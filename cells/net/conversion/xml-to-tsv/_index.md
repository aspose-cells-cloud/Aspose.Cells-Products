Get Excel Cloud SDK for .NET source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-cells-cloud/aspose-cells-cloud-dotnet) to compile the SDK yourself or head to the [Releases](https://github.com/aspose-cells-cloud/aspose-cells-cloud-dotnet/releases) for alternative download options. 

Also have a look at Swagger-based [API Reference](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/cells/#/Conversion/PutConvertExcel) to know more about the [Excel REST API](https://products.aspose.cloud/cells/curl/).
