title: Converts a spreadsheet in cloud storage to the specified format.
description: This method accesses a spreadsheet file directly from cloud storage, converts it into the desired output format (e.g., XLSX, PDF, CSV), and returns the converted result without downloading the file to the local system. \nEnsure that the cloud storage configuration (such as access credentials and file path) is correctly set up. \nThe conversion process happens entirely within the cloud environment, minimizing data transfer overhead and enhancing security by keeping sensitive data within the cloud infrastructure. \nIf the source file does not exist, or if an error occurs during the conversion process, an appropriate exception will be thrown. \nSupported output formats depend on the underlying conversion service capabilities.
